# simpleTax
A simple income/tax tracking program written in python

simpleTax is an easy way to record and track your net income, along with the taxes you pay as a percent of gross, and as a dollar amount. 

dev goals:
1) implement json to track net pay and corresponding pay date as a dict {date: netpay}

** this is my first repo, nothing fancy so any ideas to make it better or easier to use are welcome!
